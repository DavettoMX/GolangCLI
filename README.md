# CLI Using Golang

This is a small CLI tool that I wrote to help me learn Golang. It is not meant to be used in production.

It has the following features:

- Say hello
- List files in a directory
- Change directory
- clear screen
- exit the console

It is written in Golang and uses the following packages:

- "bufio"
- "fmt"
- "os"
- "strings"

This CLI is meant to be used for learning purposes. But in a future version, it will be used for real tasks to help to develop faster.
